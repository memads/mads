Testing the mean of one sample An illustrative and fairly common statistical hypothesis test is the one sample t-test. You use it when you have one sample and you want to test whether that sample likely came from a population by comparing the mean against the known population mean. For this test to work, you have to know the population mean.(Rainfall)
